## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

In 2023, I radically changed my life by enrolling in School 21â€”an innovative educational project for developers. Despite having no prior programming experience, I immersed myself fully in my studies. The structured program not only provided fundamental skills but also cultivated creative thinking and problem-solving abilities. This experience marked a turning point: I transformed from a beginner into an enthusiastic coder, confidently growing in the profession. Today, I take pride in my achievements and continue striving for new heights in technology.
