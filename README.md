## Hi there 👋

In 2023, I decided to radically change my life by enrolling in School 21, a Savings educational project for developers. Despite my lack of programming experience, I fully immersed myself in my studies, where a structured program not only provided fundamental skills, but also developed creative thinking and the ability to solve complex problems. This experience was a turning point: from a beginner, I turned into an enthusiastic coder, confidently growing in the profession. Today, I am proud of my achievements and strive for new heights in the field of technology.
